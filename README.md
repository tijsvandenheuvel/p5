# p5_visuals

This repo contains some p5.js projects

## Evolution 1

This is a simple example of evolutionary algorithms.

The rockets learn to reach the target by reproducing and evolving.

## Evolution 2 

This is a simple example of evolutionary algorithms.

The rockets try to survive by eating food. The faster a rocket goes, the faster it dies. Healthy rockets can reproduce.

There is one big fast rocket that eats rockets.

## ant simulation 

This is an attempt to simulate ant behavior.

The ant try to find the food and when they found it they bring it back to the colony.

The ants search the food by random walks and following feromones left by other ants.

## bigtree

This is an attempt to simulate growing a tree.

This project is at a very early stage at the moment.
